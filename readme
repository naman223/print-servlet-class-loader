this servlet will find the class loader.
--------------------------

So what  I did now:

I had SimpleServlet.war and deployed with target as server and virtual host. So same app available on server and virtual host.

Now access app from server and virtual host and check class loader.

If this understanding is correct then both ClassLoader are same. 


--------------------------

Did same in weblogic. Same app targeted from myserver and virtual host.

Access them differently like http://localhost:7001/SimpleServlet/ and http://test.com:7001/SimpleServlet/.

It's showing me same class loader. 

--------------------------

So showing same class loader for server and virtual host on both gf and wls.
